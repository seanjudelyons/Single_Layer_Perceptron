## About
This code explains a few fundamental concepts of neural networks and how they can be used to make predictions, specifically in the context of predicting house prices. 

Aimed at those new to machine learning, it breaks down complex ideas into simple, easy-to-understand language, using practical examples and code snippets. 

There is a step-by-step walk-through the training process, including key concepts like backpropagation, loss calculation, and gradient descent. By the end, youâ€™ll be able to build your own model to make predictions.
